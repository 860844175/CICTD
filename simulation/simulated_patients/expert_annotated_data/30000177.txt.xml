The patient, a middle-aged South East Asian male with a history of Type I Diabetes Mellitus complicated by neuropathy and gastroparesis, presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy with manifestations (ICD Code: 25061). His vital signs on admission included a temperature of 97.8Â°F, heart rate of 106 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and significantly elevated blood pressure of 190/112 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed hyperglycemia with a glucose level of 330 mg/dL, an elevated alkaline phosphatase level of 330 IU/L, and a urea nitrogen level of 89 mg/dL, indicating underlying renal dysfunction. The acuity level was rated at 2.0. The patient was stabilized with IV fluids and medications to manage his symptoms, and he was admitted for further evaluation and treatment.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has an extensive medical history including Type I Diabetes Mellitus with complications such as gastroparesis, retinopathy, nephropathy with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring home hemodialysis, and recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). He also has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and chronic anemia. Previous admissions document episodes of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting attributed to gastroparesis and esophagitis, as well as poorly controlled diabetes with hyperglycemia. He has undergone evaluations such as EGD and CT imaging, revealing severe esophagitis and gastroparesis. Despite compliance with an optimized regimen including Reglan, erythromycin, and ondansetron, recurrent flares continue to impact his quality of life. His medical management involves regular hemodialysis, insulin therapy, and medications for gastroparesis and hypertension, along with preparations for a potential kidney-pancreas transplant. Comprehensive care, including careful blood pressure and glucose monitoring and regular follow-ups with his healthcare team, remains critical.
