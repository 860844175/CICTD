<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, an elderly white male, presented to the emergency department following multiple falls, the most recent resulting in severe back pain. He reported worsening gait over the past few weeks and described his home as cluttered, posing significant fall risks. On admission, the patient was noted to have a T-11 vertebral compression fracture with 50% loss of height on imaging, as well as old posterior rib fractures. He also exhibited hypertension with a blood pressure of 189/96 mmHg, though other vital signs, including temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, were stable. Laboratory findings were unremarkable, and there were no indications of acute intracranial or other fractures based on CT imaging. He was evaluated by neurosurgery, who recommended conservative management with a TLSO brace and physical therapy. The patient was discharged home with support services after being fitted for the brace and provided with instructions to wear it whenever out of bed. Concerns about cognitive decline and alcohol use were noted, prompting recommendations for primary care and neuropsychological follow-up.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a documented history of hypertension and peripheral neuropathy, with a social history suggesting heavy alcohol use and possible cognitive decline. This visit highlighted a significant fall risk associated with his living environment, as well as his admitted memory issues. Imaging revealed no acute fractures beyond the T-11 compression fracture but did note evidence of prior rib fractures and mild degenerative changes consistent with age. His history and presentation raise concerns about underlying alcohol-related health issues, including potential cognitive impairment and poor home safety. The patient requires ongoing support, including blood pressure management, alcohol cessation counseling, and a safer living environment. His medical history underscores the importance of coordinated care to address both physical and social determinants of health.
