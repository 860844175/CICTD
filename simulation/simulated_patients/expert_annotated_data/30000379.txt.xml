<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, an elderly white female, presented to the emergency department as a walk-in with a chief complaint of generalized abdominal pain (ICD Code: 78907) and a reported pain level of 7. Her vital signs were largely stable with a temperature of 97.6Â°F, heart rate of 56 bpm, respiratory rate of 18/min, and blood pressure of 112/66 mmHg. Laboratory tests revealed elevated alkaline phosphatase (169 IU/L) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (79 IU/L), indicative of potential liver dysfunction, but other markers, including ALT, AST, and lipase, were within normal limits. Sodium levels measured at the low end of normal at 133 mEq/L. A brief hospital course included admission for further evaluation of her abdominal pain and potential underlying causes. The patient remained stable throughout her evaluation and was admitted for further observation and management.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a history of recurrent abdominal pain, as indicated by previous ED visits, including a notable visit on 2136-06-14 where she reported abdominal pain with a pain level of 8, and another on 2136-05-02 where she experienced significant unintentional weight loss of 40 lbs. Her prior diagnoses include complications of the digestive system (ICD Code: 99749) and abnormal weight loss (ICD Code: 78321). During these encounters, her vital signs showed a pattern of stable blood pressure and slightly elevated heart rates, consistent with possible chronic malnutrition or gastrointestinal distress. The patient has also undergone a significant outpatient workup for malnutrition, which included imaging and endoscopy. Social stressors, depression, and a history of alcohol use were noted as contributing factors to her nutritional deficits, although she denied recent alcohol use during prior evaluations. Her complex medical and social history underscores the need for multidisciplinary care, including nutritional support and mental health resources.
