<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, a middle-aged white female, presented to the emergency department with complaints of low back pain (ICD Code: M545) rated at a pain level of 7. Vital signs on arrival included a temperature of 98.9°F, heart rate of 78 bpm, respiratory rate of 19 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and blood pressure of 155/56 mmHg. The acuity level was rated at 3.0. No laboratory tests were performed during this visit. After evaluation and symptom management, the patient was discharged home with instructions to follow up with her primary care provider if symptoms persist or worsen.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient’s medical history includes visits for acute pharyngitis (ICD Code: J029) in 2114, where she reported a sore throat with a pain level of 6, and for a blister on the right foot (ICD Code: S90821A) in the same year, with associated right ankle pain. Additionally, she reported lower abdominal pain (ICD Code: 78909) in 2113, with a pain level of 4. These prior conditions appear unrelated to the current complaint of low back pain. However, her history highlights a pattern of musculoskeletal and soft tissue issues that may require further evaluation if recurrent pain persists. Follow-up care should focus on pain management and assessment for any underlying structural or chronic conditions contributing to her back pain.
