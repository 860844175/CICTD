<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, a middle-aged Hispanic/Latino female of Puerto Rican descent, presented to the emergency department with a diagnosis of unspecified intestinal obstruction (ICD Code: K56609). She arrived as a walk-in, reporting severe abdominal pain rated 8/10, with no associated nausea or vomiting. Vital signs included a temperature of 98.4Â°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 17/min, oxygen saturation of 98%, and blood pressure of 127/77 mmHg. Laboratory findings revealed elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 54 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase at 204 IU/L, and urea nitrogen at 22 mg/dL, with abnormalities in urinalysis including significant white blood cells (93/hpf), protein (30 mg/dL), and hyaline casts (84/lpf). Imaging showed no definitive signs of bowel obstruction, although nonspecific bowel gas patterns were noted. She was admitted for further evaluation and management, including intravenous fluids, pain control, and close monitoring for potential progression of obstruction.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a history of recurrent abdominal pain and gastrointestinal complications, including past diagnoses of right and left upper quadrant pain (ICD Codes: R1011, R1012), epigastric pain, and hyperkalemia. Notable episodes include visits for abdominal pain with hypokalemia, unspecified ventral hernia with potential obstruction, and ileus. She also has a history of coronary artery disease with coronary vasospasm, type 2 diabetes mellitus, migraines, restless leg syndrome, and GERD. Previous imaging has revealed ventral hernias and nonspecific bowel gas patterns. Her chronic conditions necessitate careful coordination of care, particularly with her history of liver transplantation, treated HCV cirrhosis, and previous TIPS placement. Follow-up with her primary care provider and hepatology team is crucial for continued monitoring and management of her complex medical issues.
