The patient was treated symptomatically for the allergic reaction and discharged home in stable condition with instructions for follow-up care and to seek immediate medical attention if symptoms worsened.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient’s medical history was not documented for this visit. Given the current diagnosis of an unspecified allergic reaction, a detailed history of prior allergic episodes or potential triggers (e.g., food, medication, environmental factors) would be beneficial in guiding future care. Preventive measures, such as identifying and avoiding allergens, and the potential need for medications like antihistamines or an epinephrine auto-injector, should be discussed with the patient during follow-up care.
