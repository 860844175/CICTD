<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, a middle-aged Black/African American male, presented to the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute alcohol intoxication (ICD Code: 30300). He arrived as a walk-in and exhibited no reported pain or acute distress. Vital signs revealed a heart rate of 73 bpm, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 97%, and significantly elevated blood pressure at 156/112 mmHg, suggesting hypertensive urgency potentially exacerbated by alcohol intoxication. No temperature measurement was recorded. Laboratory tests, if performed, were not documented in the available data. Despite the absence of detailed lab findings, his acuity level was rated at 3.0, indicating a moderately severe presentation. The patient ultimately eloped from the hospital before completing care or receiving discharge instructions. Follow-up care is necessary to address his alcohol use and associated health risks.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a documented history of recurrent episodes of acute alcohol intoxication (ICD Code: 30300). Previous visits occurred on 2185-06-15 and 2185-04-04, both characterized by reported alcohol consumption and associated symptoms. During the June visit, the patient reported an inability to ambulate and presented with tachycardia (heart rate of 104 bpm), a blood pressure of 145/93 mmHg, and an acuity level of 3.0. During the April visit, the patient showed signs of intoxication with a heart rate of 108 bpm and blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, with an acuity of 4.0. Both instances suggest a pattern of alcohol-related health concerns and potential complications, including hypertension and impaired mobility. Comprehensive management, including counseling and intervention for alcohol use disorder, is strongly recommended.
