<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, an elderly white female, presented to the emergency department via ambulance with a diagnosis of pneumonia caused by an unspecified organism (ICD Code: J189). Her chief complaint included a productive cough lasting 10 days, chills, and dyspnea. She reported mild fatigue and a headache but denied chest pain, nausea, or vomiting. On admission, vital signs were stable with a temperature of 97.1°F, heart rate of 54 bpm, respiratory rate of 18/min, oxygen saturation of 95%, and blood pressure of 143/73 mmHg. Laboratory findings indicated elevated urea nitrogen levels at 30 mg/dL, suggestive of mild dehydration or renal stress. Imaging revealed right lower lobe consolidation consistent with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The patient was treated with a combination of azithromycin and cefpodoxime for CAP and a five-day prednisone burst for inflammation. Her hospital stay was uneventful, and she remained afebrile and stable. She was admitted for observation and discharged to an extended care facility with instructions for a six-week follow-up chest X-ray and continued management of her chronic conditions.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a complex medical history, including left breast invasive ductal carcinoma treated with partial mastectomy and radiation therapy. She also has a diagnosis of IgA kappa multiple myeloma, managed with regimens such as Velcade, dexamethasone, and Revlimid. Past oncologic treatments were complicated by neuropathy and required adjustments in therapy. She has a history of recurrent melanoma, which required surgical excision and skin grafting. Additional chronic conditions include essential hypertension, chronic kidney disease (Stage 3), multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, arthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypercholesterolemia. Other notable diagnoses include osteoporosis, depression, age-related macular degeneration, and restless leg syndrome. Her social history indicates she resides in an independent living facility. The patient’s complex medical background necessitates ongoing multidisciplinary care, particularly for the management of her oncologic and chronic medical conditions.
