The patient, an elderly white female, presented to the emergency department as a walk-in with a diagnosis of unspecified constipation (ICD Code: 56400). Her chief complaint involved mild abdominal discomfort, with a reported pain level of 2. Vital signs showed a temperature of 97.6Â°F, heart rate of 92 bpm, respiratory rate of 16/min, oxygen saturation of 100%, and blood pressure of 144/61 mmHg. The acuity level was rated as 3.0, indicating moderate concern without immediate life-threatening complications. No laboratory tests were documented for this visit. The patient was treated conservatively and discharged home with instructions to follow up as needed. Continued outpatient management is recommended to address the underlying cause of her constipation.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a medical history that includes edema bilaterally (ICD Code: 7823), reported during a prior visit on 2172-07-31, and left shoulder joint pain (ICD Code: 71941), noted during a visit on 2173-02-27. Her prior episodes involved slightly elevated blood pressure (159/92 mmHg and 144/89 mmHg, respectively) and no significant systemic symptoms. Both conditions were managed conservatively. Additionally, the patient has presented with intermittent concerns likely related to chronic musculoskeletal or vascular issues. Her history of mild chronic conditions may suggest underlying factors contributing to her constipation, such as decreased mobility, diet, or medications. A comprehensive outpatient evaluation focusing on lifestyle and underlying contributors is recommended for ongoing care.
