<TEXT><![CDATA[==================================== Summary of Current ER Visit ====================================
The patient, a female with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, presented to the ER with confusion, disorientation, and forgetfulness, noticed by her husband and visiting nurse earlier that morning. Her symptoms, including difficulty with short-term memory and word-finding, were attributed to hepatic encephalopathy, likely triggered by a urinary tract infection as urinalysis showed leukocytes and bacteria. Lab tests revealed anemia, elevated BUN, mild acute kidney injury with creatinine of 1.4 (baseline 1.1), and stable thrombocytopenia. Imaging confirmed stable portal vein thrombosis and no new hepatic lesions. Treatment included lactulose to address confusion by inducing bowel movements, ceftriaxone for the UTI, and albumin to improve kidney function. Her mental status improved during hospitalization, and her kidney function normalized. Diuretics were adjusted to lower doses, and she was discharged on lactulose, antibiotics, and other home medications. She was instructed to follow up with her hepatologist and transplant team to continue evaluation for liver transplant and initiate treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma.

==================================== Patient History Summary: ====================================
The patient has a complex medical history primarily centered around alcoholic cirrhosis, diagnosed years earlier and currently classified as Child-Pugh Class C. Her cirrhosis has led to complications such as hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices (previously treated with banding), portal vein thrombosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with a biopsy-confirmed 2.6 cm lesion under ongoing treatment planning. She also has a history of GI bleeding, coagulopathy, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic back pain. She has experienced recurrent severe muscle cramps and underwent cataract surgery in the past. Her family history is notable for her fatherâ€™s alcoholic liver disease. Currently, she is in the process of liver transplant evaluation, and her care involves close coordination with her hepatology and transplant teams to manage both her cirrhosis and liver cancer.
