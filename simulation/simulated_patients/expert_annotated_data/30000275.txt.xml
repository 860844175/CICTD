<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, a middle-aged white female, presented to the emergency department with a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, unspecified (ICD Code: K859). She arrived as a walk-in, reporting severe abdominal pain rated at 8 out of 10, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. On examination, her vital signs included a temperature of 97.8Â°F, heart rate of 88 bpm, respiratory rate of 18/min, oxygen saturation of 99%, and elevated blood pressure of 140/100 mmHg. Laboratory findings were notable for elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at 53 IU/L and alkaline phosphatase at 224 IU/L, indicative of potential hepatobiliary involvement, though lipase levels were normal at 50 IU/L. Imaging and further diagnostics were not detailed in the report. The patient was admitted for further management, including intravenous fluids, pain control, and monitoring for complications related to pancreatitis. Her acuity level was rated at 3.0, reflecting a moderately severe presentation.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a longstanding history of pancreatitis, including both acute and chronic episodes. Previous visits for pancreatitis date back several years, often presenting with similar symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Chronic pancreatitis has been attributed to a cystic fibrosis gene mutation, though imaging has not consistently shown structural pancreatic abnormalities. She also has a significant history of other medical conditions, including cardiomyopathy with a preserved ejection fraction, hypertension, depression with past suicide attempts, and polysubstance abuse. Past diagnostic evaluations have ruled out obstructive or mass-related causes of pancreatitis, and her condition has been managed with pancreatic enzyme supplements and pain medications. Socially, she has a complex family history, including heterozygosity for CFTR gene mutations in both biological parents. This recurrent pattern of pancreatitis, combined with her underlying medical conditions, underscores the need for comprehensive and coordinated care.
