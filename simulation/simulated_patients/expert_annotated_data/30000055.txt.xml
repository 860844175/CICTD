<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, a middle-aged female of unspecified race, presented to the emergency department with complaints of ear discomfort. She was diagnosed with impacted cerumen (ICD Code: 3804), a condition she has previously been treated for. On examination, her vital signs were stable with a temperature of 99.4°F, heart rate of 85 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of 100%. Blood pressure was not recorded during this visit. The patient was ambulatory and exhibited no acute distress. She was treated for cerumen impaction and discharged home in stable condition with instructions for follow-up care as needed.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a prior documented history of impacted cerumen, having presented previously on October 25, 2154, with left ear pain. During that visit, her vital signs included a temperature of 97.4°F, heart rate of 89 bpm, respiratory rate of 16 breaths per minute, oxygen saturation of 100%, and elevated blood pressure of 160/93 mmHg. The acuity level at that time was rated at 4.0. No additional chronic conditions or significant medical history are documented. The patient’s recurrent cerumen impaction suggests the need for preventive strategies, such as routine ear hygiene or scheduled earwax removal, to avoid further discomfort or complications.
