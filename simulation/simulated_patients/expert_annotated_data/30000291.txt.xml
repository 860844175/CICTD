<TEXT><![CDATA[============== Summary of Current ED Visits ==============
The patient, a middle-aged white male, presented to the emergency department with a diagnosis of epistaxis (ICD Code: R040). He arrived as a walk-in reporting a nosebleed. Vital signs showed a temperature of 98.2Â°F, heart rate of 96 bpm, respiratory rate of 18/min, oxygen saturation of 100%, and elevated blood pressure of 142/113 mmHg. The patient denied pain or other associated symptoms. The acuity level was rated at 3.0, indicating a moderately severe presentation. The patient was treated and stabilized in the emergency department. Following management of the epistaxis, he was discharged home with instructions for follow-up care and blood pressure monitoring, as hypertension may have contributed to his condition.

============== Medical History ==============
The patient has a history of recurrent epistaxis, with multiple visits documented in the past for similar presentations. On October 17, 2130, he was treated for epistaxis with elevated blood pressure recorded at 171/92 mmHg. This episode was followed by a visit on October 18, 2130, also for epistaxis, during which blood pressure remained elevated at 156/98 mmHg. A subsequent visit on October 20, 2130, involved nasal packing removal, during which blood pressure was 144/91 mmHg. The pattern of recurrent nosebleeds and consistently elevated blood pressure highlights the need for ongoing management of hypertension to reduce the risk of future episodes and associated complications.
